# COVID-19_Tracing
This project was completed for a course in the Fall of 2020; myself and a team of my classmates wrote Python simulation code to prove the effictiveness of COVID-19 tracing apps in curbing the spread of the virus.

What did I do:  For this project, all the code was written utilizing the pair programming method.  So, I can't really lay claim to any one part of it.  BUT, what I did do was all of the documentation per our professor's requests.  This can be found as a PDF in the repository, and I've also included the code we wrote in case it is of interest.  

Why is this important:  I not only love to code, but I love to write as well.  This has proven to be one of my most helpful skills in securing great teams for projects (because most CS majors can't write a paper to save their life).  I wanted to showcase my writing abilities and prove they are a valuable assest to a team of coders.
